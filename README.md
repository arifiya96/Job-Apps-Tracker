## Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Job Tracker Overview
This is a simple CRUD application using react to track the job applications you apply to. It can do the following things:

- Make an account to save all the jobs you have applied for. 
- Add a job application where you can input various things about the job such as company name, location, salary and status.
- Update the status of your application.
- View all your applications in an interactive table. Click on the table fields to sort values.
